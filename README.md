## Project Description

The Hangman game is a digital rendition of the classic word-guessing game. In this version, the computer randomly selects a word, and the player attempts to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. 

The aim of this project is to provide a fun and interactive way to play Hangman against the computer. Through the development of this game, I learned about the Python programming language, including control structures, data structures like lists and strings, and the randomization of word selection.

Steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git`

2. Follow the on-screen prompts to guess letters.
